# PE01 - Programming Structures and Functions

## Assignment 1 (Prime Numbers - Code Logic)
An application that allows the user to input a number. After clicking the Validate button, the user will be informed whether the entered number is a prime number or not.

> ### Functionalities
> * A check is implemented to ensure that the entered number is indeed a (positive integer). In case of incorrect input, the user receives a notification and can make a valid entry.
> * Prime numbers are displayed in green.

## Assignment 2 (Conversions - Code Logic - Use of Functions)
An application where a user can enter a (positive integer) and a second (positive integer) used as the **base** for the conversion. After clicking the Conversion button, the user will see the representation of the first number in the specified numeral system.

> ### Functionalities
> * For the conversion, one or more functions are written, building upon the knowledge acquired in Basic IT Skills or Basic Knowledge. The toString() function is **NOT** to be used.
> * A check is implemented to ensure that the entered numbers are indeed (positive integers). In case of incorrect input, the user receives a notification and can make a valid entry.
> * The base can be a maximum of 16 (conversion to hexadecimal). Provide an appropriate error message when this requirement is not met.
